                               <li>The original residents of this area in Cape Town were descendants of slaves brought in from Africa and Asia and were Muslims. </li>
                            <li>As part of their religion they celebrate Ramadan – the Islamic month of fasting.</li> 
                            <li>At the end of the holy month it is tradition to dress up in brightly coloured clothes and at the same time many of the residents then paint their houses. </li>
                            <li>The reason for getting so many different colours is that the residents and neighbours discuss together what colours they are painting their houses to avoid colour clashes or two houses painted the same colour next to each other.</li>

                          <li>This bustling little square, is full of stall-holders selling locally produced arts and crafts creating a really colourful experience.</li>
                          <li> Greenmarket Square is very much part of the history of Cape Town dating back to 1696 and the days when it was originally used as a slave market and then a fruit and vegetable market.</li> 
                          <li>The market also attracts a wide variety of street entertainers who will certainly put a smile on your face.</li>

                         <li>Easily recognized by its mustard yellow exterior and stunning backdrop view of Table Mountain, the castle continues to draw tourists to its location as a popular attraction.</li> 
                         <li>The castle has several scheduled tours throughout the day including a Castle After Dark tour, where visitors can explore the supposedly haunted hallways in the evening.</li>
                         <li>The construction of the castle started in 1666 and finally completed in 1679. The castle has stood for more than three centuries, surviving through wars and terrible weather.</li> 
                    
                         <li>Hundreds of people were imprisoned here during the Second Boer War and the jail cells were never removed.</li> 
                        
        
                         <li>The Castle of Good Hope also housed a bakery, banquet hall, church, living quarters and various other services.</li> 
                         <li>Keep in mind, when you walk through the rooms, you may notice an occasional horseshoe hung up in several areas, they were put there for good luck.</li>
